# dao-voting-cw721-roles

This contract works in conjunction with the [cw721-roles contract](../../external/cw721-roles), and allows for a DAO with non-transferrable roles that can have different weights for voting power. This contract implements the interface needed to be a DAO DAO [voting module](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/DAO-DAO-Contracts-Design#the-voting-module).
